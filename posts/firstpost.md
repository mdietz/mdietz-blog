I've taken a long hiatus from writing outside of the writing I do for work.  Because of Covid-19, I've been working on lots of little projects and hobbies and this space is meant to be a place where I can talk about and document those.

## Hobbies
### Coding

The first piece of coding I want to work on is actually for this blog.  I want a "github style" daily tracker for each of my hobbies / projects that way I can at a glance tell what I'm focusing on, when progress has been made, and try and get past some of the samey-ness that the Covid WFH lifestyle has been leading to.

I'd also like to restart work on my ray tracer.

### 3D-Printing

I picked up a new 3D printer in May, it's a massive improvement over my old printers.  Turns out that the technology progressed in the 6 years since I last built a printer.  I've got the new printer setup to print very quickly.  It's got a 0.8mm nozzle and can knock out a large scale print that's got low definition but high strength in no time at all.  This means I can use it for real engineering projects and not have to babysit the printer or wait weeks to get everything printed.

## Astronomy

My first big project with the 3D printer is an equatorial mount [astrotracker](https://github.com/OpenAstroTech/OpenAstroTracker) for my DSLR.  The construction on that is done and the arduino code is loaded now I just need to do calibration and fine tuning; which I've been putting off.  With the shorter days and long nights, I'll probably find the time to finish that soon.

I'd also like to try my hand at building a telescope.  The [PiKon](https://pikonic.com/) project looks interesting, but it's built with european hardware in mind which'll make it more difficult to source in the states.

## Woodworking

I've been slowly but surely building a small woodshop in my garage.  I'm working mainly in plywood which is great since I make lots of mistakes and the cost and consequences for failure are low.  I've realized I really need a table saw or a way to efficiently do rip cuts with my circular saw to make more progress.  My next project is likely going to be the construction of a jig that'll let my circular saw act like a track saw.

## Writing

I'm going to try and split my time between creative / fiction writing and non-fiction writeups of my hobbie projects.
